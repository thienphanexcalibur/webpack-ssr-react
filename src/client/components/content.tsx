      Talking to the media on this occasion, History Professor Nguyen Thi Lien
      Hang from the New York-based Columbia University perceived that the trip,
      set to begin on September 21, holds great significance amid Vietnam’s
      growing relations with the UN and the US. It takes place ahead of the 50th
      anniversary of Vietnam’s UN membership, 30 years since the normalisation
      of the country's ties with the US in 1995 and, especially, amid the first
      anniversary of the elevation of the two countries’ relationship to the
      highest level – comprehensive strategic partnership (2023). Vietnam is an
      active member that is making more and more contributions to the UN, she
      said, noting the trip will once again demonstrate it as a dynamic and
      active country with increasing development, regardless of at regional or
      global level.
